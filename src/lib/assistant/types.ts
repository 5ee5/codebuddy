/*
 * Request/response contracts between the UI and the AI assistant.
 *
 * Every request carries a `mode` discriminant, so `AssistantRequest` can be
 * narrowed with a simple `switch (request.mode)`, both in the browser and in
 * the server-side route handlers. Learn and Debug are connected to the Claude
 * API (`/api/learn`, `/api/debug`). Practice checks answers locally without AI
 * (`lib/practice`); `PracticeRequest`/`PracticeResponse` are kept for future AI feedback.
